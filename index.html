    <h2>
      Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) are the future of web experiences. <br>
      They bridge the gap between traditional websites and native mobile apps, <br>  
      offering the best of both worlds. PWAs are websites built with modern web <br>
      technologies that deliver an app-like experience to users. They are reliable, <br>
      fast, and engaging, working on any device with a modern browser. PWAs can be <br>
      installed on a user's home screen, function offline or in poor network conditions, <br>
      and provide push notifications, enhancing user engagement and accessibility. <br>
      In essence, PWAs leverage web standards to create seamless and powerful user <br>
      experiences directly in the browser.
